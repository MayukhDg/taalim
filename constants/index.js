content:"'Talim' to me is not just the name of an institution but to me the platform of a Sadhana. I have been involved with this platform since I was 6 years old, when I started enjoying listening to music at home, I met my music teacher with the help of my parents. He took me by the hand and started giving me music lessons with great care. He carefully teaches the rhythm, rhythm, melody of the song."
